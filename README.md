This is a very small SAMMI extension that needs to be loaded via the SAMMI-bridge to be used.

It allows you to specify a ws:// or wss:// url to push a message too.   It does not handle or expect any formatting and will accept any message you put there so it's up to the user to determine the correct formatting for the websocket they're attempting to interact with.
